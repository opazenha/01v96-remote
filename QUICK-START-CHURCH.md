## üîß Common Issues

### "Cannot connect to server"

**Check if server is running:**
- Windows: Look for "01v96 Remote Server" window
- Linux: `sudo systemctl status 01v96-remote`
- Mac: `launchctl list | grep 01v96`

**Restart the server:**
- Windows: Run `scripts/start-server.bat` again
- Linux: `sudo systemctl restart 01v96-remote`
- Mac: `launchctl stop com.01v96remote.server && launchctl start com.01v96remote.server`

### "MIDI device not found"

1. Make sure the Yamaha mixer is:
   - ‚úÖ Powered on
   - ‚úÖ Connected via USB or MIDI cable
   - ‚úÖ Configured correctly (see main README.md)

2. Try dummy mode first:
   - Edit the script
   - Change `midi` to `dummy`
   - Test that the interface works
   - Then switch back to `midi`

### "Port already in use"

Another program is using port 1337 or 1338.

**Windows:**
```cmd
netstat -ano | findstr :1337
taskkill /F /PID [PID_NUMBER]
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
lsof -ti:1337 | xargs kill -9
```

   - Go to the bookmarked link
   - Select your channel (e.g., "AUX 1")

2. **Adjust your monitor mix:**
   - Swipe left/right to see different channels
   - Use +/- buttons to adjust levels
   - Watch for yellow (‚ö†) and red (!) warnings

3. **Warning colors:**
   - üü¢ Blue = Good

   - üî¥ Red = Too loud! Turn down immediately

### For Sound Engineer

1. **Monitor all channels:**
   - Use the main computer or tablet
   - Switch between channel groups (CH 1-16, CH 17-32, etc.)
   - Watch for warning indicators

2. **Help team members:**
   - If someone's mix sounds bad, check their levels
   - Make sure no channels are in the red zone
   - Adjust master levels if needed

## üíæ Backup & Recovery

### Save Your Configuration

The app saves channel names and groups in:
- `config/` folder

**Backup this folder regularly!**

### If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Restart the server:**
   - See "Common Issues" section above

2. **Check the logs:**
   - Windows: `logs\server-*.log`
   - Linux/Mac: `logs/server.log`

3. **Reinstall if needed:**
   - Keep your `config/` folder
   - Download fresh copy
   - Replace `config/` folder
   - Run setup again

## üìû Getting Help

### Check Documentation

- `README.md` - Main documentation
- `AUTO-START-SETUP.md` - Detailed setup guide
- `QUICK-GUIDE-WARNINGS.md` - Warning system guide
- `MOBILE-SCROLLING.md` - Mobile usage tips

### Test in Dummy Mode

If you're having issues, test without the mixer:

1. Edit your startup script
2. Change `midi` to `dummy`
3. Restart the server
4. Test the interface
5. This helps identify if it's a mixer issue or app issue
