I dont have the 01v96 device connected at the moment, but I am willing to continue the development of the application.
I want to make some changes on this application.
1. I want the sliders to be moved by steps by clicking a +/- button that should be on the bottom of each slider. Each button press should move 5% up or down.
2. I want the root endpoint is hit to load a page that will let the user chose what is the aux channel they are about to control.
2.1. Once the channel is selected, JUST the sliders fro that aux channel is to be loaded and updatable.
2.2. We are going to make use of all the 8 aux channels, not just 4 as it right now.
3. There will be a param to be passed to the root endpoint to let the user have access to all channels (like an admin mode).
4. Lets make it more user friendly and easy to be used on a mobile setup. Make it look better, more polished and more modern. You are an amazing UX designer, I trust you on this!
