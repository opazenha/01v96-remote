Lets work on the page layout once on the mixer view. I have setup to have it verticaly and to scroll sideways.
I thought a little better on the user experience and decided that the page should be loaded in landscape mode. The phones should be sideways to better screen usage.
If the app is running on desktop or on Electron it should always be as it currently is.
Lets do this!
