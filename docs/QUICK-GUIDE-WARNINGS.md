🛑 AUDIO IS DISTORTING!
🛑 Turn down IMMEDIATELY!
🛑 Sound quality is suffering
```

## What To Do

### If You See Yellow ⚠️

1. **Don't panic** - You have time
2. **Tap the minus (-)** button a few times
3. **Watch it turn back to blue**
4. **You're good!**

### If You See Red 🛑

1. **Act quickly** - Audio is distorting
2. **Tap minus (-)** several times
3. **Get it back to blue or yellow**
4. **Crisis averted!**

## Common Situations

### 🎤 Vocalist Too Loud
```
Problem: Singer's mic is clipping
See: Red warning on vocal channel
Fix: Turn down vocal fader
Result: Clean, clear vocals
```

### 🎸 Band Too Loud Overall
```
Problem: Multiple instruments clipping
See: Yellow/red on many channels
Fix: Turn down master OR individual channels
Result: Balanced, clean mix
```

### 🎹 Keyboard Peaks
```
Problem: Keyboard hits red during loud parts
See: Red flashes during peaks
Fix: Reduce keyboard level slightly
Result: Peaks stay in yellow zone
```

## Tips for Success

### 1. **Aim for Blue** 🎯
- Most of the time, keep levels in the blue zone
- Blue = safe, clean audio
- Leave room for louder moments

### 2. **Yellow is Your Friend** 🤝
- Occasional yellow during loud parts = okay
- Constant yellow = too loud, turn down
- Yellow gives you a warning before problems

### 3. **Red is the Enemy** 🚫
- Red = audio is breaking up
- Never stay in red
- If you see red, fix it immediately

### 4. **Watch the Master** 👁️
- The "S" (sum) channel shows overall level
- If master is red, turn down master OR individual channels
- Multiple yellow channels can make master go red

## Practice Makes Perfect

### Try This Exercise:

1. **Start with everything low** (all blue)
2. **Slowly raise one channel** (tap + button)
3. **Watch it turn yellow** around level 25
4. **Keep going until red** at level 31
5. **Bring it back down** to blue
6. **Repeat until comfortable**

## Remember

- **Blue = Happy** 😊
- **Yellow = Careful** 😐
- **Red = Fix it!** 😱

## Questions?

### "What if everything is yellow?"
**Answer:** Turn down the master fader (S channel) or reduce individual channels. Multiple channels at yellow levels can add up to cause problems.

### "Is yellow bad?"
**Answer:** Not necessarily! Brief yellow during loud moments is fine. Sustained yellow means you should turn down a bit.

### "How do I know which channel is the problem?"
**Answer:** Look for red or yellow badges in the top-right corner of each channel. That's your problem channel!

### "What if I can't hear distortion but see red?"
**Answer:** Trust the warning! Distortion might not be obvious in the room but will be noticeable in recordings or through the PA system.
